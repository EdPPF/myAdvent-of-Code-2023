# [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/)

This repository maintains all my attempts at solving the problems of this year's AoC.

This is my first time participating in any sort of "competitive programming" (though i'm not seeing this as competition). The purpose of this is to improve my coding skills, specially in Rust.

The structure of this repository is as follows:

```
- /DayN
    - /Python
    - /Rust
```

Where `DayN` exemplifies all subdirectories, one for each day.

As the structure suggests, my attempts will be in **Python**, with which i'm fairly used to but need more improvement, and **Rust**, the language i started learning not too long ago.

## Happy Holidays!
